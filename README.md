## Changelog
Read below for complete changelog history.

### 14/12/2024
- Fixed an issue where AI were immune to emissions after the first one if non-lethal emissions for AI was enabled.
- Fixed an issue where AI might get stuck in the unconscious animation when ACE is enabled. (Thanks SilenceIsFatto)

### 18/02/2022
Applied changes from script version:
- Fixed distance emission is no longer supported.
- Camera shake is now tied to the camera's distance to the emission wave rather than the player's and sounds are now played relative to the camera.
- Increased audible distance for emission pulse sounds and create them further away so that they are still audible when moving rapidly.
- Adjusted light source attenuation so the sky light isn't concentrated around the player.
- The player is no longer affected by the emission wave if they have damage disabled.
- AI now use the same shelter check as players.
- Added a parameter to select what effect the emission has on non-flying vehicles (ground vehicles/ships/landed aircraft).
- Cleaned up damage related functions so there should be no clash between player/AI effect and aircraft/vehicle effect parameters.
- Fixed an issue where lightning bolts would not appear correctly in multiplayer.
- Static weapons are not affected by the emission.
- Updated default settings for 'Start Random Emissions' ZEN module (defaults were still in seconds rather than minutes).

Mod version specific changes:
- Updated editor modules.

### 19/11/2021
- Added Korean translation by Taru.

### 13/11/2021
Applied changes from script version:
- Added a new function `fn_startRandomEmissions` which can be used to create emissions at random intervals. (Suggested by Apocalypsis)
- Added a new ZEN module 'Start Random Emissions' which can be used to start and stop the new random emissions function.

Mod version specific changes:
- Added 'Start Random Emissions' editor module.

### 12/11/2021
Applied changes from script version:
- Added a new setting 'Approach direction' which determines the direction the map sweep emission will approach from. You can now choose 'North', 'South', 'East' or 'West'. (Suggested by cpt_bassbeard)

### 11/11/2021
Applied changes from script version:
- Cleaned up ZEN functions to be consistent with other TTS scripts.
- Doubled the width of the emission wave particle effect.
- Tweaked the emission particle creation to be tied to the camera's distance to the wave rather than the player character's distance to the wave. This should allow the emission wave to be visible from Zeus and Spectator.

Mod version specific changes:
- Redid support for TTS Effects AIO.

### 07/11/2021
- Fixed default settings for modules having incorrect types. Modules should not cause errors when using default settings anymore.

### 22/10/2021
Applied changes from script version:
- Added a new setting `tts_emission_shelterTypes` that controls the classes that provide shelter from the emission.
- Improved setting `tts_emission_immuneUnits`, it can now contain parent classes the same as `tts_emission_shelterTypes`.

### 21/10/2021
Applied changes from script version:
- Fixed a typo in `fn_startEmission` that was resetting siren type 'None' back to 'Classic'.
